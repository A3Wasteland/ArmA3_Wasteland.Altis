*Wasteland.Altis* by Team Wasteland!
===================

Notes about our fork:
We do not use iniDB, iniDB code may not be updated or merged. 
We use extDB, provided by torndeco (https://github.com/Torndeco/ArmA3_Wasteland.Altis) which is not updated anymore, it was used as a concept on how to use DB_CUSTOM_V3 of extDB. 
ExtDB files can be found here: https://github.com/l0dac/a3wasteland-extdb

We are not a support team. We are a community that enjoys playing arma and saw fit to modify our own A3Wasteland mission file. 







ArmA 3 Wasteland is a harsh survival sandbox mission where 2 teams and independent players fight for survival.


The mission is not ready yet, so for now it's just a placeholder :)
