/* IMPORTANT
 *
 * this only provides psudo mutual exclusion.
 *
 * there is still a race condition as the if is not using atomic test and set.
 * If you dont know what im talking about, its not incredibly important, but if
 * ocasssionaly it may stuff up and let two scripts run at the same time. Im not
 * familiar enough with the preprocessor (and how much c we can use) to create
 * a proper algorithm. that and it isnt THAT important at the end of the day.
 *
 * TLDR: It MAY let two scripts one at the same time.
