/** Take an item from the gound
 * This handles the logic of "picking up" an item from the ground.
 *
 * This is implemented using actions. the condition check of the action
 * is in "takeable.sqf".
 * Note: When an item is dropped, a variable is attached to the ground object
 * which is checked in both "takeable.sqf" and here. if this value is removed
 * for whatever reason, the inventory system will no longer be able to
 * recognise it as a "Dropped Item" and will ignore it. This is implemented
 * this way so that the inventory system does not stop anyone using objects of
 * the same type for other purposes (although it would probably cause confusion).
 *
 * This works under wastelands "mutual exclusion", and should only called
 * by an action. see https://community.bistudio.com/wiki/addAction

 * @author MercyfulFate
 * @param [target, caller, actionID, itemID]
 *      target {object} - the player "picking up" the item
 *      caller {object} - the player "picking up" the item (yes, twice)
 *      actionID {iteger} - the id of the action attached to the target
 *      itemID {string} - the id of the inventory item this object represents.
